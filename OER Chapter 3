## Introduction 

In previous chapters progams were defined as a sequence of statements which had the goal of 
accomplishing tasks. All very simple and straight forward. Within this chapter as well as chapter 5,
you will be taught how to tel a computer that it doesn't have to follow a simple statement, and that
it can also make its own decisions and repeat statements until certain conditions are met.
