# Input/Output

##Objectives

After completeing this chapter students will be able to:

1. Identify input and output streams
2. Read data from the standard input device
3. Describe input stream functions get, ignore, putback, and peek
4. Write data to the standard output device
5. Use manipulators in a program to format output
6. Perform input and output operations using the string data type
7. Read data from a file (include examples)
8. Write data to a file (include examples)

## Introduction

In chapter 2 you were introduced to some of the C++ input/output (I/O) instructions,
which get data into a program and print the results on the screen. You used c i n 
and the extraction operator >> to get data from the keyboard, and c o u t and the 
insertion operator << to send output to the screen. Because I/O operations are fundamental
to any programming language, in this chapter, you will learn about C++ I/O operations in
more detail. First, you will learn about statements that extract input from the standard input
device. You will then learn how to format output using manipulators. In addition, you
will learn about te limitations of the I/O operations associated with the standard I/O
devices ad learn how to extend these operations to other devices.
