##Introductions 

In the previous section, we covered how decisions are integrated into programs. In this chapter, we'll shift our focus to how programs 
handle repetitive tasks. We'll explore loops and iterations, which are essential tools for improving program functionality. By the end of 
this chapter, you'll have a solid understanding of how incorporating repetitions enhances the strength and adaptability of computer 
programs.
